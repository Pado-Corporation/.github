# Creating Waves of Positive Change

The word “pado(파도)” is Korean for (tidal) waves. The future is built from so called “waves” of innovation. These innovations are derived from inflections of technological breakthroughs. In Pado, we hope to create more value in the real economy using technology for a better future.

# Pado Phenomena

You can observe four [wave phenomena](https://stickmanphysics.com/stickman-physics-home/unit-10-waves/wave-phenomena/) in all waves. Similarly, we have the Pado Phenomena.

1. **A**mbition - Yes, we’re pretty damn ambitious.
2. **B**ravery - Yup, totally. We brave af.
3. **C**ompletion - Get shit done. This distinguished us from others.
4. **D**iscipline - We try to pursue the minds of special forces.

# Our Dream

We aim to alleviate humanity from everything that is NOT essential. We want people to focus on what they love doing. We want to save their time to let them focus achieving great things. That’s what we stand for. We innovate the future by empowering humanity.
